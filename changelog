the-devil (1.2.1) maverick; urgency=low

  * Added better controller autodetection. The game will now look for a dual-
    analog controller first and set keyboard controls if it doesn't find one.
  * Save each controller config separately to prevent glitches on the config
    screen. This also makes it easier to switch control types as it will now
    remember configs for each type of controller.
  * Fix potential crash bugs in title screen related to the leaderboard.
  * Allow Backspace to be used on Mac OS X to delete letters when entering ID.
  * Fix blinking cursor on Internet options screen, shown when entering ID.
  * Add autodetect option to Controls options screen.
