v1.3
----

[ ]Use bitmap graphics for touch helpers.

[ ]Add enemy and control indicators around player sprite to make it easier to
   play on touch devices.

[ ]Add new display option for filling the screen. We should place in-game HUD
   using t3d_display_top, etc.

[ ]Reset clipping rectangle before drawing touch helpers in case there are black
   bars around the screen. This will allow the touch helpers to render outside
   the view.
