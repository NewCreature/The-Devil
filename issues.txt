v1.3
----

[X]Use bitmap graphics for touch helpers.

[X]Add enemy and control indicators around player sprite to make it easier to
   play on touch devices.

[X]Reset clipping rectangle before drawing touch helpers in case there are black
   bars around the screen. This will allow the touch helpers to render outside
   the view.

[X]Hide cursor on Android port.

[X]Add touch friendly menus using larger font.

[X]Add new display option for filling the screen. We should place in-game HUD
   using t3d_display_top, etc.

[X]Implement Back button.

[X]Clicking the right arrow to change Control Type causes crash when moving
   past Mouse + Keyboard.

[X]Need to implement Touch Small, Touch Medium, and Touch Large control types.

[X]Show soft keyboard when choosing the name entry menu item.

[ ]Fix crash around level 10.

[ ]Fix menus that have settings that don't apply to touch devices.

[ ]Add quit confirmation menu.

[ ]Add touch-specific Network ID menu that is centered in the top half of the
   screen. This is so the user will be able to see the text they are typing when
   the soft keyboard is being displayed.

[ ]Add credits screen.

[ ]Update cinemas. Only load images needed for each scene to conserve memory.
   might switch to WordLeap cinema engine.

[ ]Add debugging info to initialization phase so we can try to figure out what
   is preventing the build from running on OS X 10.6.
