v1.4
----

[ ]Figure out what is causing the seemingly random crash when trying to load
   the leaderboard. It seems to happen when internet access is flaky.

[ ]Remove T3 logo and put copyright message on title screen.

[X]Consider making mouse+keyboard the default control scheme.


v1.3
----

[X]Use bitmap graphics for touch helpers.

[X]Add enemy and control indicators around player sprite to make it easier to
   play on touch devices.

[X]Reset clipping rectangle before drawing touch helpers in case there are black
   bars around the screen. This will allow the touch helpers to render outside
   the view.

[X]Hide cursor on Android port.

[X]Add touch friendly menus using larger font.

[X]Add new display option for filling the screen. We should place in-game HUD
   using t3d_display_top, etc.

[X]Implement Back button.

[X]Clicking the right arrow to change Control Type causes crash when moving
   past Mouse + Keyboard.

[X]Need to implement Touch Small, Touch Medium, and Touch Large control types.

[X]Show soft keyboard when choosing the name entry menu item.

[X]Fix menus that have settings that don't apply to touch devices.

[X]Add touch-specific Network ID menu that is centered in the top half of the
   screen. This is so the user will be able to see the text they are typing when
   the soft keyboard is being displayed.

[X]Fix crash around level 10.

[X]Fix crash on menu display when switching away and back on Android.

[X]Add privacy info screen.

[X]Fix cinema text being drawn behind graphics in ending.

[ ]Figure out when we need to load the icon from the bitmap file. Most platforms
   should handle the icon through packaging.

[ ]Add credits screen.

[ ]Add debugging info to initialization phase so we can try to figure out what
   is preventing the build from running on OS X 10.6.
